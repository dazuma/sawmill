          <h2>Sawmill</h2>

<p>Sawmill is a logging and log analysis system for Ruby.
It extends the basic Ruby logging facility with log records and logfile parsing features.</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>A user reported a bug in your Rails application, and now you have to figure out what happened. You can spend hours poring over megabytes of text log files, stretching your grep-fu to its snapping point... or you can use Sawmill.</p>

<p>Your CEO wants to know how many people viewed the new product pages last week. You can write yet another arcane sed script looking for that elusive pattern in the log files... or you can use Sawmill.</p>

<p>Sawmill is an extension to the standard ruby Logger mechanism that enables automated log analysis. Designed especially for web applications using Ruby on Rails and similar frameworks, Sawmill originated in the source to <a href="http://www.geopage.com">www.geopage.com</a>, where it has been analyzing the production Rails logs for more than three years.</p>
