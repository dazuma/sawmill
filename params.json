You can spend hours poring over megabytes of text log files, stretching your grep-fu to its snapping point... or you can use Sawmill.\r\n\r\nYour CEO wants to know how many people viewed the new product pages last week. You can write yet another arcane sed script looking for that elusive pattern in the log files... or you can use Sawmill.\r\n\r\nSawmill is an extension to the standard ruby Logger mechanism that enables automated log analysis.
